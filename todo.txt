search order precendence:
	previous entries that match arg
	sub dirs that START with arg
	sub dirs that CONTATIN arg

don't save backref only (i.e. "..\*n")

fuzzy logic behaviors
	- save possible matches (both previous used matched entries and matched local dirs)
	and the one used (first)
	- when next called without arg, cd to first after last used in previous set; update last used
	- maybe emit the set list with numbers on entries and indicator showing which entry is active

when arg contains environment separator (e.g. / or \)
	set search context to relative location and search there
		jd "..\x"
			context is ".\..\"; search "x"
		jd "\x" context is "\" (root); search "x"

extra commands:
	-s[tats] show history with jump counts, etc.
	-c[lear] clears the history
	-v[erbose] display details on what it's doing to standard error stout reserved for return value 

other ideas:
	"ji" (i.e. jump into) pushd but with jumpDir searching
	"jo" (i.e. jump outof) popd
